<h2>For those of you that can't or won't JailBreak!
<br/>A new generation resigning tool.... Beta Version Released!</h2>
<p>AppAddict are proud to announce that we are bringing you the next generation of resign tool. When we bring you a tool we make sure it is done right and we pack it full of powerfull, usefull features with a great user experience.
<br/>
AppAddict Tools will be no exception to this, we have released the beta version which will help people resign and install their cracked apps <strong>without the need of a JailBreak!</strong> This is great for people who have accidently updated past iOS 6.1.2, for people wanting to try out iOS 7 or simply for people who don't want to JailBreak their devices but still want to benefit from the use of cracked iOS apps</p>
<br/>

<h2>What is resigning apps?</h2>
<p>Usually to install cracked apps you would need to be jailbroken in order to install something called AppSync, this is used to allow your device to install apps that have been cracked.
<br/>However you are still able to install cracked apps if you are not jailbroken simply by downloading and resigning your cracked apps. Resiging apps basically passes the cracked app through a program that embeds a development certificate into the app and then allows that app to be installed to your device via iTunes as if you were testing it. The apps are full versions and exactly the same as if you had purchased them from the AppStore.
<br/>
<br/>AppAddict tools is <strong>OS X only app</strong>, however <strong>Windows users can still use it</strong> with the use of an OS X virtual machine that can be found at <a href="http://betaio.so/cracking.html" target="_blank">BETAiO.So</a> this image is custom made by RegMyUDiD and full easy to follow guide is included!
<br/>
<br/>There are a few things you need in order for this to work and we wil explain what they are and how to obtain them</p>
<p>1 - AppAddict Tools - Available <a href="aatools/aatools.zip">here</a> this is the tool that will resign your apps

<br/>
<br/><strong>Developer Certificate</strong> is used by AppAddict Tools to embed into the apps to enable installation on non jailbroken devices
<br/><strong>Provisioning Profile</strong> is installed on your device to allow your device to sync the resigned apps
<br/>
